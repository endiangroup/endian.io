    "**Candidate sourcing**<br /><br />Once the profile is signed off, we can start tapping our networks for potential CTOs. We put every candidate through a qualifying process, so the large pool we start out with typically ends in a promising handful. We'll then introduce to you to the most viable candidates.",
    "**Interviews and hiring**<br /><br />The exact hiring and selection process is of course up to you, but we'll help set up meetings and keep the candidates engaged during the process. All you have to worry about is choosing a CTO. (If you're not confident with technical evaluations, we can help; see the optional extra below).",
    "**Onboarding your new CTO**<br /><br />After you've found your perfect match, we'll help negotiate terms and get them settled in. Depending on your situation, you may want to hire a new technical team --- and we'd love to help with that process!",
